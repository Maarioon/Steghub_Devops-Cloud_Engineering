# Self Study: Configuration Aspects of Apache `mod_proxy_balancer` Module

The `mod_proxy_balancer` module in Apache is used to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple backend servers, ensuring **load balancing** and **high availability** for web applications. Below is a simple breakdown of key configuration aspects:

## 1. Load Balancing Methods  
The module supports various algorithms to distribute traffic:

- **RoundRobin**: Requests are sent to backend servers in a circular order.
- **LeastConn**: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **Bytraffic**: Routes traffic based on the server’s network load.

## 2. Sticky Sessions (Session Persistence)
Sticky sessions, also called **session affinity**, ensure that once a user is connected to a particular backend server, they remain on that server for the duration of their session. This is crucial for applications that store session data locally (like shopping carts). 

In Apache, sticky sessions are implemented using cookies or session IDs to track and route a user’s requests to the same server.

Here’s how to configure it:

```apache
<Proxy "balancer://mycluster">
    BalancerMember "http://backend1" route=1
    BalancerMember "http://backend2" route=2
    ProxySet stickysession=SESSIONID
</Proxy>


##  Balancer Manager
Apache provides a web-based Balancer Manager to monitor and manage load balancers dynamically. It allows you to:

Add or remove backend servers.
Change balancing settings without restarting the server.
Enable it with the following configuration:

```
<Location "/balancer-manager">
    SetHandler balancer-manager
    Require all granted
</Location>

```

By properly configuring load balancing methods and sticky sessions, you ensure well-distributed traffic and better session management, ultimately improving the reliability of your web applications
