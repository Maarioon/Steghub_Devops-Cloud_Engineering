## 1. IP Address
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, enabling communication between devices.

### Types:
- **IPv4**: The most common type, formatted as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **IPv6**: A newer standard with eight groups of hexadecimal numbers, designed to solve IPv4 exhaustion (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).

## 2. Subnets
A subnet divides a larger network into smaller, manageable segments, improving organization, efficiency, and security by isolating traffic flow.

### Subnet Mask:
- Defines the network and host portions of an IP address (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).

---

## 3. CIDR Notation
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) defines IP ranges with a suffix representing fixed bits in the address.
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24`

---

## 4. IP Routing
IP routing determines the best path for data packets across networks using IP addresses and routing tables.

### Routing Tables:
- Databases storing route information to guide packet delivery.

---

## 5. Internet Gateways
An Internet Gateway connects a private network (e.g., a Virtual Private Cloud) to the internet, enabling bi-directional communication.

---

## 6. NAT (Network Address Translation)
NAT translates private IP addresses to public ones, allowing private network devices to access external networks securely.

### Types:
- **NAT Gateway**: Used in cloud environments for outbound-only internet access.
- **NAT Instance**: A managed instance for similar functionality, requiring more configuration.

# OSI Model and TCP/IP Suite

## OSI Model
A conceptual framework with seven layers, defining how data transmits across networks.

### Layers:
1. **Physical**: Hardware connections (e.g., cables, switches).
2. **Data Link**: Node-to-node transfer and error handling (e.g., Ethernet).
3. **Network**: Routing and addressing (e.g., IP).
4. **Transport**: Reliable data transfer (e.g., TCP).
5. **Session**: Establishing communication sessions.
6. **Presentation**: Data formatting (e.g., encryption).
7. **Application**: Application-specific processes (e.g., HTTP).

---

## TCP/IP Suite
A four-layer model simplifying the OSI model for practical use on the internet.

### Layers:
1. **Network Interface**: Physical connections and network interfaces.
2. **Internet**: Routing and addressing via IP.
3. **Transport**: Reliable connections (e.g., TCP, UDP).
4. **Application**: Communication protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

### Connection to the Internet:
- The TCP/IP suite forms the backbone of internet communication, enabling end-to-end solutions.

# AWS IAM Policies

## 1. Assume Role Policy
Defines *who* or *what* (principals) can assume the role.

### Example:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

2. Role Policy
Defines what actions the role is permitted to perform on AWS resources.

Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    }
  ]
}

Key Differences:
Scope of Control:
Assume Role Policy: Controls who can assume the role.
Role Policy: Controls what the role can do once assumed.
Execution:
Assume Role Policy: Evaluated when assuming the role.
Role Policy: Enforced after role assumption.
Together, these policies ensure secure and managed cross-account or cross-service access within AWS.
