Cron is a powerful job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems that allows tasks to be run automatically at scheduled intervals. This self-study guide provides a brief overview of how Cron works, its syntax, and common use cases.

## Basic Concepts

### What is Cron?
Cron is a daemon that runs in the background and executes scheduled commands or scripts at specific times and dates. It is commonly used to automate repetitive tasks like backups, updates, and monitoring.

### Crontab
Crontab (cron table) is a file where the scheduled jobs are defined. Each user on the system has their own crontab file, which can be edited using the command:

```bash
crontab -e
```

* * * * * /path/to/command
- - - - - 
| | | | |
| | | | ----- Day of the week (0 - 7, where 0 and 7 represent Sunday)
| | | ------- Month (1 - 12)
| | --------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| ----------- Hour (0 - 23)
------------- Minute (0 - 59)


Common Examples
Run a job every 5 minutes:
```
*/5 * * * * /path/to/job.sh
```
