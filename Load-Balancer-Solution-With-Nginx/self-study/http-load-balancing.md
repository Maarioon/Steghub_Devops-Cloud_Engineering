Load balancing is a key technique for ensuring that your web applications run smoothly and efficiently by distributing traffic across multiple servers. It helps maximize resource usage, minimize delays, and make systems more reliable. In a nutshell, NGINX and NGINX Plus make this process seamless, acting as a highly effective HTTP load balancer in various setups.

To start load balancing with NGINX, you define a group of servers, known as an upstream group, which will share the load. The servers in this group handle incoming traffic based on specific rules. For instance, if one server is getting too busy, another less-used server can take on some of the requests. This is where different load-balancing methods come in.

Load Balancing Methods

Round Robin (default): Distributes requests evenly across all servers, considering their capacity.
Least Connections: Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
IP Hash: Keeps requests from the same IP address going to the same server for consistency.
Generic Hash: Routes requests based on custom keys, such as the request URI or a combination of data.
Least Time (NGINX Plus): Chooses servers based on response times to ensure the fastest results.
Random: Selects servers at random, ideal for complex distributed environments.
You can fine-tune these methods by setting weights for each server (to prioritize some over others) or by configuring backup servers that only get traffic when the main servers are unavailable.

Additional Features

Session Persistence: Ensures that all requests from a user session go to the same server, improving user experience, especially for stateful applications.
Server Slow-Start: Prevents a recovering server from being overwhelmed by traffic after coming back online.
Connection Limits: Controls the number of active connections to each server, queueing requests when limits are reached.
NGINX Plus even provides features like health checks to automatically monitor server performance and remove failing servers from the pool until they recover.

In summary, NGINX makes sure your applications remain available, responsive, and scalable, no matter the size of your infrastructure.
